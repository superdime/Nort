# Nort
If you couldn't guess, spell Nort backwards. This is a small pixel-like 2D game made with HTML Canvas. It was originally made for Unity and under C#, but I found serious issues trying to accomplish a Tick-based game within Unity.

## Purpose
This is mainly used to help me learn how design influences coding. Overall, I hope to make a decent game that is data-centered. That way, the underlying game can be transferable elsewhere easily and still intact (at least at the design level).

## Structure
- Design Folder - Holds Design information such as diagrams and decisions.
- Game Folder - Holds the game.
